# Envelopster

![Right Hemisphere](Right-Hemisphere.png)

This is a demotool for interactive development of shader-based demos that use time-based envelopes for graphic effects. An envelope is an arbitrary piecewise linear function that maps time into a real value. Although these can be handled in code, it is typically much easier to store and modify them externally.

This tool was used during development of the [Right Hemisphere](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=83559) demo.
